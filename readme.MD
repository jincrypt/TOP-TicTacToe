# Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

[Live Preview](https://jincrypt.github.io/TOP-TicTacToe/)

## Criteria:
* Skeleton HTML/CSS/JS
* Store gameboard as an array inside of Gameboard object. Players also to be objects.
* Use modules and factories (use as little global code as possible)
* Set up HTML & JS functions to render content of gameboard
* Build functions to add markers to a specific spot on the board and tie together with the DOM.
* Build logic to check for when the game is over (win or draw).
* Clean up interface to include start/restart button along with a game completion message (win or draw).

## Extras:
* Implement vs computer option. [COMPLETE]
* Create an unbeatable AI using minimax algorithm (additional reading) [COMPLETE]

## Todo:
### Project has been completed for now. Future potential improvements:
* Computer calculation is visibly slow after player presses button. Improve algorithm for faster minimax implementation (possibly using depth)
* Alternative is to add constant delay for computer's move so it flows better.
* Update CSS.
* Add animation for move placement.
